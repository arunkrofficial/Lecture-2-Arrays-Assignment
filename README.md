# Eight Questions and Solutions

This repository contains solutions in JavaScript for eight coding questions. Each question is briefly described, and the corresponding solution is provided in code format.

## Questions

1. Maximize Sum of Minimized Pairs: Group integers into pairs and maximize the sum of the minimum value in each pair.

2. Maximum Number of Different Types of Candies: Determine the maximum number of different types of candies that can be eaten.

3. Longest Harmonious Subsequence: Find the length of the longest harmonious subsequence in an array.

4. Can Place Flowers: Check if a given number of flowers can be planted in a flowerbed without violating adjacent flower rule.

5. Maximum Product of Three Numbers: Find the maximum product of three numbers in an array.

6. Search in Rotated Sorted Array: Perform a binary search for a target value in a rotated sorted array.

7. Monotonic Array: Determine if an array is monotonic (either non-decreasing or non-increasing).

8. Minimum Score of Increasing/Decreasing Array: Calculate the minimum score of an array after performing an operation on each element.

## Usage

1. Review the code for each question in the corresponding JavaScript file.

2. Modify the input values as needed or add additional test cases.

3. Execute the code in a JavaScript environment or editor to see the output.
